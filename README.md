# Project - Codename : NEGRONI

If you want to work on the project, you have to use Xcode or git to download the project.

Every, feature you'll be working on should be worked on inside a new branch. I (Gigi) suggest to name the branch with your first name initial and the number of branch you created. Like if this is the first branch for Domenico, he should name it `D-001`.

##Â Download the project

I (Gigi) recommend to use the `git` command line utility (already installed on your MacBook alongside Xcode).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GEDAF/Negroni
```

If this command needs you to login, I (Gigi) suggest to use `[gh](https://cli.github.com/)` (you can install it with brew if you have brew with `brew install gh`).
With `gh`, just type:

```bash
gh auth login
```

And follow the instructions.


Then you can retry the previous command to clone the repository. I also recommend to **NOT** clone it in your user directory.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Developer
```

This command will help you by creating a "Developer" folder in your user directory.

Then you can resume the process:

```bash
cd ~/Developer
git clone https://github.com/GEDAF/Negroni
```

If you want the easy step to open the project just type:

```bash
open ~/Developer/Negroni/Negroni.xcodeproj
```

That's it.
